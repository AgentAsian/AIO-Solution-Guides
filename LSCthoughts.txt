Ok so i have just read the question and some thoughts come to mind.

Obviously i can just brute force and im hoping that it works. I could use binary search with this. However, this is not ideal. 

I'll keep thinking until i get insight.

Ok so i have some new ideas. if we know that there is radius R, cant we just move a giant block of size 2*R+1 across and when we see a new store just add it to the houses in the block

I think that this will work and im excited. Once a house leaves the block we check if a pamphlete with this sum is available and if not just binary search the next possible etc etc.

Also i saw the time limit is a whole 3 seconds which is really large, a bit surprised honestly.

Ok i think that this approach would need some improvement. there is no way i'm iterating through like l when its a billion haha. I will just jump to the next smallest instead of incrementing by 1
