# AIO-Solution-Guides
Detailed solution guides for problems in the Australian Informatics Olympiad. I wanted to share my experience on these problems and how i came to a solution. I learn from USACO from a tutor site and also by learning off USACO guide. Hope to get into the IOI team some day.


I use a template i found from user InsertAReallyCreativeName. check out file 0template for it. I just copy and paste it for every task so i dont waste time writing the basic skeleton.


I think that usually for CP problems, especially the harders ones, you should be thinking for equally if not more time than actually coding. You need to just think and recognise patterns you found in previous questions.

Find a good community for comp prog discussion. I have a place on X-camp where i post my questions and i recieve feedback.

In the AIO i suggest breezing past 1-3 in 30 minutes then hopefully passing 4 which normally is doable in 30 minutes. You roughly 2 hours on the last questions which are the only hard ones. 

I'm still learning to master the 5-6 questions to do fast. Usually i may not finish them ever. I suggest if you want to actually try for the AIO you begin to post your answers online and write up answers as it allows you to reflect.
